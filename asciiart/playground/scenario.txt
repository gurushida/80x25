Opening scene

At home with Amy. Everything fine with syrupy love. Want
to google for proposal ring. The search engine has a disclaimer
popup saying it has been updated to use automatic suggestion from
searches done in your geographical neighborhood. Start typing "pro..."
and get horrible results. Amy sees it and makes a scene. Try to call her
but she has blocker the number. Guy needs a miracle.


Part 1: the miracle

Get net from Scottish fisherman at the docks.
In the arcade shop, learn about drones and that the pharmacy uses one.
Talk to the pharmacist and learn that he uses one to deliver prescriptions.
Talk to the biker bouncer at the pub that has a cold. Offer to take
his prescription paper to the pharmacy for him. Give it to the pharmacist so
he uses his drone to deliver the drug.
Capture the drone that delivers drugs from the pharmacy with net.
Talk to the arcade guy to convince him that the drone is yours and that
you lost the remote controller to get a new one.

Go inside the cinema. Jam the popcorn machine. Go outside.
Talk to the cashier about the popcorn machine to have him
leave. Take the movie review. Go to the ice cream shop.
Give the review to the cashier to get a free ice cream.
Go give the ice cream to the little girl in exchange for
her jumping rope.

Go the pub. The bouncer asks for ID. Make a joke rant about about
how we are always supposed to get some ID in adventure games.
In the pub, talk to cosplayers and learn about the forge (evil queen,
chinese master, monk, Brian April).

Go to the arcade. Take the hard drive out of the broken machine.
Give the drive to the blacksmith so he can crush it. Take the magnet.

Combine the rope, the drone and the magnet. Go to the park
and fish coins from the fountain.

Go to the arcade. Use coins to play evil spell. Beat the highscore
to win the prize of the day: the djinn lamp.

Use the lamp to get the djinn out. When he asks for your wish,
have multiple joke wishes, including one about character death with
a joke about the Holy Book of Ron that says characters should never die.



Part 2: the ring

Go to the jewellery. Learn how much money is needed for the ring.
Go the bank. Learn about m-coin and the italian startup. Go the restaurant.
Talk to Don Covfefe to learn about 'Mining Analog Flows Of Input Association'.
Get a shady assignment completed to earn some m-coins.

The assignment is to help a guy at some address, but the address is unreadable. Once the
assignment is given, Don Covfefe pretends he doesn't know anything about
it and won't help with the address. Go the pharmacy to have the address
deciphered by the pharmacist.

The guy is a farmer that needs you to give him a "business growth hacking device",
i.e. a bomb to get rid of a neighbour's barn. Th explosive is
dioxyphenylethanolisopropylamine. The recipe to make it is a McGyver one: chewing-gum,
makeup powder, fat-free yogurt, etc.


Take package from circus (juggler, monker, acrobats on the teeterboard).


Go to the bank with the m-coins. Learn that the currency went down.
Learn about Business Disability Act that could re-boost the value of the m-coin
business.

Give chili drink/food to dog. Take him to pee on the street lamp next to the
restaurant to fragilize it. Use dominoes to make it fall. Call insurance
to fill a claim for the business disability act. Go to bank to cash in the
m-coins that are now worth a lot. Buy the ring.
